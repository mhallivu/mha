Test cases
1) First time start:
    -start without any hanging processes, no logs
    -verify that logs appear and both processes exists
    -kill mock process, verify that is restarted
    -add 1000 characters to log, verify that log is swithed within 3 minutes
    -verify that only one backup log exists by doing extra 1000 charcter addition after
        swithcing to new log

2 Second time start
    -existing logs and existing mock daemon
    -verify no new daemon is started
    -verify that restarts killed daemon
    -verify that works correctly if backup log file exists but the actual daemon log file 
        is missing when process starts
    -verify that works correctly if there is actual daemon log file but not backup file.
